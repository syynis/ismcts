This is a library for Multi-Observer Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (MO-IS-MCTS)
It's not intended to be used as a stable library yet. Large changes may be made without changing semver.

The search algorithm is root parallelized, meaning that multiple processes can build the tree in parallel.
